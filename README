#########################

## Installation

Requires python 3.

Download the 1to10.py file to your local storage.

Change to the directory the file has been downloaded to, in this example 'Downloads':
# cd ~/Downloads/

Mark the 1to10.py file executable:
# chmod +x ./1to10.py

Execute the file:
# ./1to10.py

If you get errors, it maybe due to python 2 being called, but if python 3 is installed you can call it specifically:
# /usr/bin/python3 ./1to10.py
